#Program that finds the standard weight of different gender

#Standard weight : weight based on people's hight
# formula : for Man = hight(m) x hight(m) x 22
#           for women =  hight(m) x hight(m) x 21

def std_weight(height, gender) : #height in meter
    if gender=="male"or"man":
        return height*height*22
    else:
        return height*height*21
#ex) male who has 175cm
height=175
gender="male"
weight = round(std_weight(height/100,gender),2)
print("For {}cm {}'s standard weight is {}. ".format(height, gender,weight))
